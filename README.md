# Time series demo

The ipython notebook uses monthly rainfall data from one district in India for a short time series demo.

This includes:
- seasonal decomposition
- identifying the best parameters for a seasonal ARIMA model
- running the SARIMA model along with diagnostics
- generating predictions

The PDF contains a few short slides on definitions and a list of additional resources.

Many thanks to this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-with-arima-in-python-3) which served as the basis for this demo.
